The [Document Picture-in-Picture API][spec] makes it possible to open an always-on-top window that can be populated with arbitrary HTML content. It extends the existing [Picture-in-Picture API for `<video>`] that only allows for an HTML video element to be put into a Picture-in-Picture window.

The Picture-in-Picture window in the Document Picture-in-Picture API is similar to a blank same-origin window opened via [`window.open()`], with some differences:
- The Picture-in-Picture window floats on top of other windows.
- The Picture-in-Picture window never outlives the opening window.
- The Picture-in-Picture window cannot open windows.
- The Picture-in-Picture window cannot be navigated.
- The Picture-in-Picture window position cannot be set by the website.

## Try out the API

During the trial phase you can test the API by one of two methods.

### Local testing

To experiment with the Document Picture-in-Picture API locally, without an origin trial token, enable the `chrome://flags/#document-picture-in-picture-api` flag.

### Register for the origin trial

Starting in Chrome 111, the Document Picture-in-Picture API is available as an [origin trial](/docs/web-platform/origin-trials/). It is expected to end in Chrome 115 (June&nbsp;21, 2023). [Register here](https://developers.chrome.com/origintrials/#/trials/active).

## Use cases

### Custom video player

While a website can provide a Picture-in-Picture video experience with the existing [Picture-in-Picture API for `<video>`], it is very limited in what inputs the Picture-in-Picture window can take and the look-and-feel of those. With a full Document in Picture-in-Picture, the website can provide custom controls and inputs (e.g. [captions], playlists, time scrubber, liking/disliking videos, etc) to improve the user's Picture-in-Picture video experience.

### Video conferencing

It is common for users to leave the browser tab during a video conferencing session for various reasons (e.g. presenting another tab to the call or multitasking) while still wishing to see the call, so it's a prime use case for Picture-in-Picture. As above, the current experience a video conferencing website can provide via the [Picture-in-Picture API for `<video>`] is limited in style and input. With a full Document in Picture-in-Picture, the website can easily combine multiple video streams into a single PiP window without having to rely on [canvas hacks] and provide custom controls like sending a message, muting another user, raising a hand, etc.

## Examples

Let’s have a custom video player and a button element to open the video player in a Picture-in-Picture window.

```html
<div id="playerContainer">
  <div id="player">
    <video id="video"></video>
  </div>
</div>
<button id="pipButton">Open Picture-in-Picture window</button>
```

### Open a Picture-in-Picture window

Call `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()` when user clicks the button to open a blank Picture-in-Picture window. The returned promise resolves with a Picture-in-Picture window Javascript object. We can use it to manually move the video player to with [`append()`] for instance.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow();

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

### Set an aspect ratio for the Picture-in-Picture window

You can pass some options as a dictionary to `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()`:
- The `initialAspectRatio` option sets the desired Picture-in-Picture window aspect ratio.
- The `lockAspectRatio` option makes sure the Picture-in-Picture window aspect ratio will remain constant if set to `true`.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window whose aspect ratio is
  // the same as the player's and locked.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow({
    initialAspectRatio: player.clientWidth / player.clientHeight,
    lockAspectRatio: true,
  });

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

### Copy style sheets to the Picture-in-Picture window

When set to `true`, the `copyStyleSheets` option passed to `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow()` makes sure the CSS style sheets of the originated window are copied and applied to the Picture-in-Picture window. Note that this is a one-time copy.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window with style sheets copied over
  // from the initial document so that the player looks the same.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow({
    copyStyleSheets: true,
  });

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);
});
```

### Handle when the Picture-in-Picture window closes

Listen to the window `"unload"` event to know when the Picture-in-Picture window gets closed (either because the website initiated it or the user manually closed it). The event handler is a good place to get the elements back out of the Picture-in-Picture window as shown below.

```js
pipButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const player = document.querySelector("#player");

  // Open a Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipWindow = await documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow();

  // Move the player to the Picture-in-Picture window.
  pipWindow.document.body.append(player);

  // Move the player back when the Picture-in-Picture window closes.
  pipWindow.addEventListener("unload", (event) => {
    const playerContainer = document.querySelector("#playerContainer");
    const pipPlayer = event.target.querySelector("#player");
    playerContainer.append(pipPlayer);
  });
});
```

You can close the Picture-in-Picture window programmatically by using the [`close()`] method.

```js
// Close the Picture-in-Picture window programmatically. 
// The "unload" event will fire normally.
pipWindow.close();
```

### Listen to when the website enters Picture-in-Picture

Listen to the `"enter"` event on `documentPictureInPicture` to know when a Picture-in-Picture window is opened. The event contains a `window` object to access the Picture-in-Picture window.

```js
documentPictureInPicture.addEventListener("enter", (event) => {
  const pipWindow = event.window;
});
```

### Access elements in the Picture-in-Picture window

You can always access elements in the Picture-in-Picture window through `documentPictureInPicture.window` as shown below.

```js
const pipWindow = documentPictureInPicture.window;
if (pipWindow) {
  // Mute video playing in the Picture-in-Picture window.
  const pipVideo = pipWindow.document.querySelector("#video");
  pipVideo.muted = true;
}
```

### Handle events from the Picture-in-Picture window

You can create buttons and controls and respond to user's input events such as `"click"` as you would do normally in JavaScript.

```js
// Add a "mute" button to the Picture-in-Picture window.
const pipMuteButton = pipWindow.document.createElement("button");
pipMuteButton.textContent = "Mute";
pipMuteButton.addEventListener("click", () => { 
  const pipVideo = pipWindow.document.querySelector("#video");
  pipVideo.muted = true;
});
pipWindow.document.body.append(pipMuteButton);
```

## Feature detection

To check if the Document Picture-in-Picture API is supported, use:

```js
if ('documentPictureInPicture' in window) {
  // The Document Picture-in-Picture API is supported.
}
```

## Interfaces

`documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow(options)`
: Returns a promise that resolves when a Picture-in-Picture window is opened.
  The promise rejects if it's called without a user gesture.
  The `options` dictionary contains the optional following members:

  `initialAspectRatio`
  : Sets the initial aspect ratio of the Picture-in-Picture window.

  `lockAspectRatio`
  : When `true`, the Picture-in-Picture window aspect ratio will remain constant.
    The default value is `false`.
  
  `copyStyleSheets`
  : When `true`, the CSS style sheets of the originated window are copied and applied to the Picture-in-Picture window. This is a one-time copy.
    The default value is `false`.

`documentPictureInPicture.window`
: Returns the current Picture-in-Picture window if any. Otherwise, returns `null`.

`documentPictureInPicture.onenter`
: Fired on `documentPictureInPicture` when a Picture-in-Picture window is opened.
